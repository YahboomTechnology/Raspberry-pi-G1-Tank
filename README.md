# Introduction
Yahboom Raspberry Pi Tank Robot uses the latest Raspberry Pi 4B development board as the core controller. The vehicle adopts blue aluminum chassis, high-quality track, high-power 370 motor, and metal coupling. When the motor drives the wheel of the car to rotate rapidly, it can achieve the function of climbing up to 60 degrees under the condition of sufficient friction. For this Raspberry Pi tank, real-time video transmission is indispensable. We use a 2DOF camera pan/tilt, a HD USB camera, and the 5G WIFI network that comes with the Raspberry Pi to ensure that high-quality video can be transmitted in real time on mobile APP or PC. It can also complete some AI recognition functions through the camera. Both expansion board and frame we are providing the corresponding extended interface, users can expand and use it according to the information provided by us, so for the tank, educators, learners, and raspberry lovers will be the most suitable owners.
